# Home Automation
Home automation with a Raspberry Pi as the central hub.

This is a personal project for a home automation system. Feel free to use any part of this repository for your own project!

# Architecture
## Hardware
A schematic of the physical setup is shown below:

![A router is connected to: a Home PC that acts as a controller and viewer, a Lolin D1 Mini that acts as a thermometer and a Raspberry Pi that acts as database and MQTT broker.](images/schematic-physical.png "Schematic of the physical devices.")

Further detail of each "component" will be presented in their corresponding folder.

No data or information will be available or transmitted outside of the LAN (for now).
